Stock Price Prediction with Deep Learning Model

1. Analyzed the volatility feature of stock price and market index.
2. Built an RNN long short-term memory model (LSTM) to predict stock prices on PyTorch.
3. Trained LSTM models and tuned the model by changing sequence lengths, number of layers and dropout values on GPU. 
4. Evaluated model based on its performance (RÂ² score: 0.89) on test datasets.
